    <header><h1>FASTEST 2 MOTORS IN THE WORLD </h1><br>

        A motorcycle, often called a motorbike, bike, or cycle, is a two or three-wheeled motor vehicle.[1][2][3] Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport including racing, and off-road riding.<br> Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.

The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle.[4][5]

In 2014, the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were Honda (28%), Yamaha (17%) (both from Japan), and Hero MotoCorp (India).[6] In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy. <br>Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.

According to the US Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.[7]

    <H2> <q> <mark>DODGE TOMAHAWK-TOP SPEED: 330 MPH
    </q></H2>

    <p> Even cars have a hard time keeping up with such raw speed. This superbike carries within it an 8277CC 10 valve, four stroke engine that is simply a dream. The dodge tomahawk has four wheels and each of them has its own suspension. Also, this is the same engine found in the Dodge Viper, ( 8.3-liter V10 Dodge Viper SRT10). The transmission on this bike is a two-speed manual toe shift and uses the traditional chain and sprocket system. The place that was supposed to house the headlights is actually a throttle intake and the bike also has a cooling system placed behind the intake manifold. The Dodge Tomahawk has no rival to this day, however, due to its four wheels and a few other reasons the bike isn’t certified for legal use in the USA. It can clock 0-60 somewhere in between 1.75 – 2.5 seconds and hits its max power of 500 HP at 5600 RPM.</p>
    <h2><mark>KAWASAKI NINJA H2R </mark>– TOP SPEED: 222 MPH </h2>

    <p>This one is another beast in the form of a bike. With a 998CC liquid cooled, 4 stroke , in-line four, DOHC, 16-valve engine this thing can go fast, and we mean fast! Due to its speed, Kawasaki managed to install an electronic rider support suite. It has the KTRC (Kawasaki TRaction Control), KIBS (Kawasaki Intelligent anti-lock Brake System), KEBC (Kawasaki Engine Brake Control) and KLCM (Kawasaki Launch Control Mode). These, apart from protection, keep the bike running smooth. The Kawasaki Ninja H2R hits 60 in a mere 2.5 seconds. Now that is fast! The bike hits it max power of 197.3 bHP at 11,000 RPM.</p>

    <h3>Bill Warner</h3> 
    <p>An American who set the world record for fastest speed on a conventional motorcycle, died on Sunday after losing control while trying to top 300m/ph (483km/h) at a former air base in the US.

        The speed racer and Florida fish farmer was clocked at 459km/h before he lost control.</h3><br>

<p>It was unclear how fast the motorcycle was travelling when it veered off a runway and crashed, according to Tim Kelly, race director for the Loring Timing Association, which hosts the annual timed speed event at Loring Air Force Base in Limestone, Maine.

    After the crash, Warner was conscious and talking but died about 75 minutes later in hospital.
